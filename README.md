# (Demo) Speech2TextApp
## an Android app developed to try SpeechToText API.
#
# How to use
#
### Click the start button and it starts listening. With a signal tone, a Toast text appears "Je vous Ã©coute" meaning "I'm listening" in French.

### You can start to speak. Your speech is sent to the server. After few seconds, your speech appears on the screen. 
#### During my test, the speech recognition was good with a real device with a French language module downloaded.
#### On an emulater, it often encounters wrong recognition as shown in the image below.

## Sometime, it cannot recongnize at all and shows a Toast message "Error_No_Match".

### It continues to listen in loop until the command *"Bye, Bye"* to finish the listening is pronounced.
### Another commande *"Ok, google"* makes the app read loud texts written on the screen.
