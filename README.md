# (Demo) Speech2TextApp
## Android app developed to try SpeechToText API.
#
# How to use
## Click the start button and it starts listening. Toast text appears "Je vous Ã©coute" ("Listening" in French).
## You speak. Your speech appears on the screen. 
### During my test, the speech recognition was good with a real device with French language module downloaded.
### On an emulater, it often encounters wrong recognition.
## You pronounce "Ok, google". It makes the app read texts written on the screen.
## Pronouce "Bye, bye" to finish the listening

# SDK API 19 or later required

# Technology included
SpeechToText, TextToSpeech
